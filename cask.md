# cask

Download most things in one go with cask. You will need [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and then tapping cask.

```
brew tap caskroom/cask
```

Once it's available, do:

```
brew cask install \
    the-unarchiver \
    iterm2 \
    zsh \
    vscode \
    google-chrome \
    firefox \
    opera \
    sketch \
    zeplin \
    spotify \
    slack \
    vlc \
    dropbox \
    google-drive \
    megasync \
    transmission \
    appcleaner \
    color-oracle \
    imageoptim \
    imagealpha \
    recordit \
    caffeine \
    vanilla \
    rocket \
    muzzle \
    spectacle
```
